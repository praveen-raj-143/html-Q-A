<h2>3. What are self-closing tags?</h2>
<p>In HTML, A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not to be closed by closing tag, which means there is no separate closing tag for it as </tag>.
</p>
<p>Elements that don't have any content are called <b>empty elements.</b>
</p>
<p><b>< br ></b>  is an <b>empty element</b>  without a closing tag (the <b>< br ></b>  tag defines a line break).
</p>
<p>Empty elements can be "<b>closed</b>" in the opening tag like this: < br />.
</p>
<p>Example: < img /> ,  < input /> ,  < br />.</p>

<h2>5. Difference between block and inline?</h2>
<p>A block element always begins on a new line and extends to left and right, and it takes the full width available on the webpage. Browsers automatically add some space(margin) before and after element.
</p>
<p>Examples of block elements are < div>, < p>, < h1>to< h6>, < table> and < form> etc.
</p>
<p>An inline element does not begin on a new line. It only takes the space that is necessary for it.

<h2>6. Difference between < em> and < strong>?</h2>
<p> The < strong> and < em> tags are used for emphasizing parts of a text.
</p>
<p>The < strong> tag should be used to indicate strong importance, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it.
</p>
<p>The < em> tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both tags can be used together, where it makes sense.</p>
